TEDally:
     - I attempted to recreate the TED site. The same issues I've run into before seemed to become an issue again. I know the smaller components and how to make them work, but combining them together can seem overwhelming. In this particular case, I'm incredibly lost when it comes to breakpoints. I understand how they're supposed to work and I understand the display:none properties and that sort of thing, but actually setting them up the right way has me at a loss. I also had some issues getting the video to work. I kept getting a path error or something like that. And last thing (I promise), I had issues with moving things around to the left or the right using Foundation.

Shoppers Delight:
     - Okay, so going into this one, I wanted to use Mustache, but even after getting some clarification from you, I forgot how to go about replacing the content within the {{ }} braces. So that was an issue. I know to use the mustache script tag and to create an empty script tag and put my soon to be created element in there though. In addition, I spent a few hours working on getting the page set up and getting the cart right. I know there is a DRY'er way to set up the buttons, but again I'm rusty. I absolutely will not lie about forgetting some things over the week and a half we had off. I have each of the buttons set up the way I think they should be, but weirdly enough I can't seem to figure out how to add the created "product" items into the "cart" list using the buttons. 

So to put it all together here (and I've told you this before), I feel confident in saying that I understand what I need to do concept wise to make things function at this point. For the most part at least. If you asked me to set up any of these pages, I could tell you how to do it concept wise, but I can't necessariy just build it off the bat without having to consider which aspect to start on. Hopefully that makes sense.
